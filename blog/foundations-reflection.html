<h2> FOUNDATIONS REFLECTIONS
</h2>
<h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
<li> I’m not too sure about new things that I’ve learn’t about myself, I’ve found that I continued to be what I usually am like when it came to school work, meetings etc. Although I have found that even though I try or should be asking more questions, I tend to still not do that and will result to just finding the resolving problems on my own most the time unless I really can’t progress without figuring something out. 

</li>
<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
<li>The amount of working that has be allocated. I didn’t expect the load to be this much but then again I signed up to do the more intensive course so I should’ve expected it anyway.</li>

<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
</h3>
<li>The programming part lol, just understanding all these different things and knowing how they work is just so much to take in. I think many others that are on the same boat are struggling to keep up in a way because there is so much new stuff to learn and to remember which definitely makes it very challenging.</li>

<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
<li>Because it helps us strengthen our skills in coding and in all these different coding languages. With more core exercises it allows for us to better understand the content rather than just being thrown it and asked to just understand without actual hands on work to understand what’s really going on, finding the faults in our coding etc.</li>

<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
<li>A little bit, but not at the same time. Some things I think I could’ve just learned online from other resources, but at the same time the interactions with the facilitators really separated and elevated the experience as a whole.  </li>
