    <h2><u>Research Neuroplasticity</u></h2>
<h2> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
</h2>
<li> Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people because it helps people understand the brain and how the connection between mental and physical link together. The brain’s ability to change and adapt allows for better learning and memory due to better suggestive strategies to aid with how the mind and body work. Ultimately, it allows for individuals to better understand themselves and how they may / should tackle different tasks with our everyday lives.</li>
<h2> Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
<li> I may engage with the principles of neuroplasticity by understanding everything with a deeper meaning. Not thinking so simply, that things often have a slightly deeper meaning or reasoning behind why it may work. Such as x works with y because x and y have z to assist etc. 
</li>
  <h2> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
  <h3> Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
  <li> Some ways I can increase my neuroplasticity is by doing more researching and increasing my understanding of whatever I’m doing. Any work I struggle with, I will continue to research, understand, and try to apply it to other work that I’m working on. This will allow me to grow and better understand the things that I’m doing.  </li>

  <h2><u>Research Growth Mindset</u></h2>
  <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h2>
  <li>Growth mindset refers to an individual's ability and intelligence that can be developed and improved over a period of time through effort, perseverance, and learning. It’s incredibly relevant because without a growth mindset, you’ll end up having a ‘fixed mindset’ which believes that things can’t change or better themselves. By introducing growth mindset, it promotes a more positive and proactive approach to learning, challenges, and personal development. It allows for a belief that everything can be taken another step above rather than sitting at a plateau. </li>
    <h2> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
    <li> No, I believe that everyone should have a growth mindset where there is more to learn and explore. I like to have the mindset of once you achieve something that you’ve been trying to get at for a while, there should be then be a new like goal that should now be the next challenge, to also help grow yourself as a person. If you ever struggle and just can’t get past, don’t let that stop you. Hence the growth mindset, enabling yourself to grow, continuing to work on challenges, and not giving up, you will be able to grow.</li>
  <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
  <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
  <li>I will integrate it by continuing to learn and improve my skills of coding over the foundation period. There is never a “I’ve learned it all now, and I’ll just leave it now” there’s always more to learn and explore so I will strive to learn as much as I can and not let ‘learning everything provided’ stop me from learning more.

  <h2><u>Blend with your learning plan and strategies
  </u></h2>
  <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>
  <li>These understandings may shape or influence my learning plan and strategy because there are new skills and techniques being introduced. Because I did further research, it has expanded my idea and what I originally thought of each of these concepts so it will greatly influence my plan and strategy that I have created.</li>
