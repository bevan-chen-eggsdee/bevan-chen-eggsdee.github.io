<h2> What is Emotional Intelligence?
</h2>
<li> Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand, recognise, manage, and express emotions in an effective way toward yourself and others. It involves self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and relationship management. Emotional Intelligence helps individuals with their social communicative interactions and allows for better understanding and consideration of how others feel.</li>
<h2> How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
<li> While EQ and IQ are both measures of human skills, they both cover different aspects of cognition and behaviour. EQ relates to the emotional understanding of oneself and others. IQ relates to cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, logical thinking, information taking, and others.
  Someone with low EQ would have a failure of understanding other peoples emotions and knowing how to react do specific emotions from others or itself. Someone with high EQ on the other hand would understanding how other’s are reacting to certain situations and be able to speak in a way that comforts and fits into the ‘mood’ of things. 
  Someone with low IQ would struggle with more ‘hard thinking’ tasks and tend to have a more simple thought process on how to target problems. On the other hand, high IQ people would have a deeper and more thorough thought process when targeting a problem or having to tackle certain tasks. There is a greater thought process before acting on what needs to be done.
</li>
  <h2> Why is EQ important?</h2>

EQ enhances the way we communicate with individuals due to being able to express and empathise with how people think. </li>
