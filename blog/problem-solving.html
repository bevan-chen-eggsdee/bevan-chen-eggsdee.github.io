<h3>When I was blocked on a problem</h3>
<li> The problem that I was blocked on was the ‘manipulating-objects’ kata part where I couldn’t figure out why the spouse keys kept failing. I had completed all the other parts which were passing fine, but for some reason, the spouse key was failing whatever I did. I used the rubber ducky method going over each part one by one to understand what’s going on and why that specific part is failing. I felt so lost, had no idea what I was failing when it looked perfectly fine. Turns out it was just a simple grammatical error causing it to fail over and over. I learned to really pay attention to what I’m writing, even simple spelling or grammatical mistakes are going to cause problems.
</li>

<h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>
<li>Working on the fizzbuzz kata, I was getting an error with the FizzBuzz, Buzz, and Fizz where the values were returning the incorrect string so they were failing when it was being tested. I used the rubber ducky method again to look through the code and explain which parts did what and then found that I had assigned the incorrect strings therefore leading to failed testing. Feeling pretty silly again, same as the manipulating-objects kata, simple mistakes where I hadn’t looked over properly. Having a proper re-read and explaining each part of code helped me find the mistake as from a first glance or just a glance over the code there doesn’t appear to be any problems. But once all the work is explained to yourself, you understand it better.</li>

<h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
<li>Pseudocode</li>
<li>Trying something</li>
<li>Rubber ducky method</li>
<li>Reading error message</li>
<li>Console.logging</li>
<li>Googling</li>
<li>Asking your peers for help</li>
<li>Asking coaches for help</li>
<li>Improving your process with reflection</li>

<li class="margin">Fairly confident with most of these problem solving techniques. Ones I don’t use enough is probably console.logging and asking peers and coaches for help. Pseudocode is super useful to setup steps for myself to work through. Trying something and just attempting helps me get a rough idea, if it fails reading error messages helps me understand where i’ve gone wrong in my coding. The rubber ducky method is good in the sense that it helps me get a good idea explaining things over again to myself to understand what I’ve actually typed down. Google just super helpful in general, any problems and google will most likely have the answer to as I’m still a beginner coder so the code that I’m working on will most likely be done before.</li>
<h3>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h3>
<li>Just too scared to ask sometimes. Especially when the question seems silly, it’s almost a little embarrassing to ask so I get too scared to ask for help and try to work on things myself. I will try to ask for help regardless of how simple or easy it may be, but I’ll see with time.</li>
