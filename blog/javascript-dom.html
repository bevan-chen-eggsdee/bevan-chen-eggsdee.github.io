<h2> An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.

</h2>
<li> We can use the analogy of building a house. HTML is like the foundation of the house, the structure and layout of the place. CSS is the interior design of the place, colour, design, and overall aesthetics of the place. JavaScript is like the wiring and electricity to a place. Without the wiring to the house, there will be no functionality for appliances, anything electrical. </li>
<h2> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h2>
<li> Using making a sandwich to explain control flow and loops. 
  Control flow refers to the order in which things are executed in relation to making a sandwich, the order which you place all the toppings! For example, you can go by   
</li>
<ol class="center">
  <li>Getting the bread</li>
  <li> Buttering the bread</li>
  <li> Adding lettuce</li>
  <li> Adding ham</li>
  <li> Closing up the sandwich</li>
  </ol>
  <li> Following an order in a sequence one after another is similar to control flow where instructions are executed in a specific order. 
    Looping is like repeating a set of instructions over and over again till you’re satisfied with how many times it’s been executed. Referring back to the sandwich, it’s making the desired amount of sandwiches till you’re happy with how many has been made. Following the same instructions used for control flow to make the sandwiches. 
    </li>
    <h2> Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </h2>
    <li> The DOM refers to the Document Object Model which is the interface provided by the web browser representing a tree-like structure of a website. Each tree branch corresponds to a part of the document such as the elements, attributes, or text content. With the structure provided by the DOM, Javascript can be used to manipulate and interact with the document. 
      An example of this can be sitting at a desk with a bunch of sticky notes each representing different elements of the webpage such as text, colour, size, etc. Each of these elements can represent the selection of an element, changing of contents, adding or removing elements, and responding to interactions. 
    </li>
    <h2> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </h2>
    <li> Arrays refer to the ordered collection of similar items by numerical indices, and objects refer to the key-value pairs by unique identifiers. 
      Arrays are more ideal for storing lists of items of the same type, typically numbers and strings.
      Objects are more ideal for storing entities with properties or attributes. They’re more flexible because keys can be more descriptive compared to arrays which are just numerical indices.
      </li>
      <h2> Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.
      </h2>
      <li> Functions are blocks of code that can be defined once and executed multiple times in code. They can hold a set of instructions that perform specific tasks or calculations and are capable of accepting parameters (arguments) and returning results. 

        Functions are a building block for Javascript, they enable the reuse of code, abstraction, organisation, and many other things. The reusability of code allows for simplicity and less confusion with code due to repetition in different areas. 
        </li>
  <h2> Why is EQ important?</h2>
  <li> Emotional Intelligence plays a crucial role in our everyday lives. It revolves around communication, relationships, personal well-being, and many other things. With EQ, it shapes how we handle and understand situations regarding emotions that impact our everyday lives. EQ enhances the way we communicate with individuals due to being able to express and empathise with how people think. </li>
