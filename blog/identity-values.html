    <h3>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Moving into a flat, there needs to be communication, division of labour,
      and just overall respect for others. Chores are really important to keep
      the place nice and clean, not smelly etc. We got together and had a
      meeting regarding how we want to sort out certain chores to ensure that
      our place is clean and not look like a bin. We considered everyone's
      timetables as everyone is busy with work/study and may only be home during
      certain times of the day. We arranged chores for each person/days where a
      specific person would target a specific chore. Previously, I would be
      almost the only person that picks up other work such as cleaning cups,
      drying plates, cutlery etc. and putting everything back. I don't mind
      doing it, but in the aspect of fairness, it really wasn't fair for me.
      After having the conversation everything is running a lot smoother and our
      place looks alot cleaner!

    <h3>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Growing up in an asian household and being surrounded by asians, the
      standards that our parents have for us are typically very high. We have to
      excel in school, become a doctor, lawyer, or engineering which is greatly
      influenced by values and identity. Do well in school, so our parents can
      show us off, but what do we get out of it? Most of the time we're unhappy
      with what we're doing, but we're forced into an occupation that we
      dislike, but makes our parents happy. But I grew up not caring and just
      doing what I want. I want to feel a sense of freedom where I'm not locked
      in a cage and forced to do whatever my parents want me to do.

    <h3>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My strengths include my hard work and attention to detail. I work really
      hard when it comes to things that I'm passionate about. I also pay a lot
      of attention to detail due to a little OCD. These will help me achieve
      what I'm doing to a good high standard.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>
    <p>
      If I end up losing interest that would greatly impact my learning and
      career development. I do tend to lose interest in things quite fast
      depending on what it is. With consistent repetition, not much more going
      on/no growth, it will impact my learning. I really enjoy learning/gaining
      new skills, but if there isn't anything new being brought to the table, I
      will lose interest.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was working on a project for one of my papers in Uni and no one was
      engaging, no one was talking in the group chat to talk about what's going
      on or what they've done. I tried my best to get everyone to talk, as well
      as organise meetings in person so we can work on the project together,
      have better conversations etc. This helped the group alot because we went
      from doing our own thing, keeping most things to ourselves to being more
      open and talking about what we can improve together as a group for the
      project. I'm not sure what I would want to try out, to me, this sort of
      communication and bringing people together to do stuff together already
      greatly helps the group out.
