      What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed
      positioning?

    <h3>Relative Positioning</h3>
      <p>You can think of a picture frame on a wall. You're able to move it up, down, left, and right from where it would normally sit with relative positioning.</p>
      <p>Using CSS, you're telling the browser to move an element slightly a certain direction from where it would normally be on the webpage.</p>
      <p>Other surrounding elements on the webpage know that the relative positioned element is still there and will move their positions according as if it hasn't moved from it's original position.</p>

    <h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>
      <p>Using a sticker as an example now, you can place a sticker anywhere on a piece of paper. Absolute positioning refers to the placement of the sticker anywhere on a piece of paper.</p>
      <p>Using CSS, you're putting the element in a certain spot regardless of where it may normally sit.</p>
      <p>When elements are absolute positioned, they are no longer part of the normal flow of the webpage. This means that other elements won't move accordingly to the element like relative positioning.</p>
      
    <h3>Fixed Positioning</h3>
    <p>Imagine a toy that's tied to your arm. Wherever you go, the toy sticks with you and doesn't go anywhere else which is fixed positioning.</p>
    <p>Using CSS, with fixed positioning, the element is told to stay in the same spot regardless of whether you scroll up and down the webpage. The element will stay in the one spot no matter what.</p>
    <p>Fixed position elements are removed from the normal flow, but stay fixed relative to the browser window itself so it's like they're stuck to the screen and follow where you go.</p>
