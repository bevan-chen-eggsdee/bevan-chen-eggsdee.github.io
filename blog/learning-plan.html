    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <li>
      My long term goal or career pathway is to head into a tech related job.
      Growing up I was always really interested in techy/computer stuff, so
      after finishing Dev Academy I hope to be able to find a job in the tech
      industry to expand my knowledge even further.
    </li>

    <h3>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h3>
    <li>
      My strengths include my hardwork, listening skills, and attention to
      detail. When I have a genuine interest in something, I will always be
      super hard working because I want to be absolute to achieve whatever I'm
      doing. Always have a goal and something I want to be able to achieve.
    </li>
    <li>
      My listening skills are good because I'm a listener and tend to listen to
      whatever people say before I have my say. It's just me as a person but it
      works out so I can see what people have to say and then try to add work
      around certain things to avoid conflict.
    </li>
    <li>
      And my attention to detail stems from the little bit of OCD I have lol. I
      like things to be 'perfect' to an extent. I like it when things look nice
      and are placed nicely so it's super beneficial when coding and making
      certain things look appealing to peoples eyes.
    </li>
    <li>
      My limitations include my lose of interest. I tend to lose interest in
      things if they're repeated on and on, and there is no new changes being
      made for a extended period of time.
    </li>

    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <li>
      Being able to communicate with people would be a big plus! I'm quite a
      quiet person and I often struggle to talk to people, but if people wanna
      talk to be I'm always down to chat!
    </li>

    <h3>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include:
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
        representatives
      </li>
      <li>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </li>
    </ol>
    <li>
      The best way is to follow the guidelines that DevAcademy already has
      assigned. They have the best idea of how much times should be allocated to
      certain parts of work. I have already avoided it at the start and has
      caused me to fall behind with the work load.
    </li>
    <li>
      Making sure things are to schedule and trying not to fall behind in
      certain bits of work. Following with the flow of other students will help
      assist in making sure that work is being done productively and safely with
      others.
    </li>
    <li>
      It's not good to stress, so I will take it easy and communicate if need
      be. Definitely not keep things to myeslf and make sure I'm being open with
      the work and what I may be struggling with so others have a good idea of
      where I'm at. Communication is key, and that will be best to make sure you
      can help yourself get back on track with assistance from others.
    </li>

    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <li>
      If I ever get stuck for a extended period of time, hopefully no longer
      than 30 minutes, I will reach other to others for help rather than keep it
      to myself and attempting to fix it when I'm struggling and causing myself
      to fall behind because I keep working on the same thing over and over. Got
      stuck? Message someone ASAP.
    </li>

    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <li>
      I expect them to be able to talk with everyone and be able to see where
      people are at. If people are strugggling and falling behind, provide
      assistance and try to get them back up to pace. Try their best not to
      stress them out and commenting things that may make them more stressed
      such as "no time", "hurry up", but working around saying it's okay with
      assitance to get them back up to pace with things. Some people struggle
      and have problems that you may not know about so it's better to be kind no
      matter what and try not to stress them out.
    </li>

    <h3>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
    <li>
      Yep! Making sure that I know how much time I may have to put towards other
      commitments and then having to work a lil extra in certain areas to cover
      any time that other commitments may have taken up.
    </li>

    <h1><u>LEARNING PLAN UPDATE</u></h1>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <li>My long term goal is to be able to increase my knowledge and skills in coding and land a good job with a good salary. Then use that money to go travel overseas! If I land a good job, I’ll have that under my belt and the next job search hopefully won’t be as hard.</li>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <li>I honestly can’t think of any strengths, but I know for sure my limitations will be my shyness, so working together with other people, asking question, and stuff like that is going to quite difficult initially but hopefully it’ll get better as we progress throughout the bootcamp. Also, my understanding of code is still quite bad, I feel like I’m gonna anchor the rest of the people I work with ;-;</li>
    
    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <li>Waking up on time lol</li>

    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <li>Having a better sleep schedule lol</li>
    <li class="margin">Improving my people skills, communicating more, and trying to be more interactive. But that is gonna be hard fr</li>

    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <li>Providing enough assistance and help to us when we need it. Even when we appear to be working fine, still being approached and checking up to see how we’re going with the work ensuring that we’re on the right track etc.</li>

    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <li>Working together, communicating, and just overall learning more. I expect myself to make a few friends or just some mutuals at least and I’ll be pretty satisfied.</li>
