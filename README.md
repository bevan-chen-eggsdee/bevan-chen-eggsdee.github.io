Hellooooo everyone!!

I'm a newbie in the Web Development scene but love to make new innovative and cool products using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, React, Javascript, and many more :D

As a recent grad from Dev Academy, I have learnt numerous skills and have made awesome projects which I have displayed on my main page =3

I'm most proud of the OOTD. project which was a final group project at Dev Academy where we collectively in a 5 person group made an app using a new programming language (to us) React Native and Firebase to create an Outfit Randomisng Application. This was extremely fun to make and an awesome outcome when it was completed. 

Other smaller projects such as Jellyfish Jobs and Trolley Shop were also fun little one day group projects that we did in groups and I'm really proud of the outcome of those projects too! 

I hope to be able to create more awesome projects with others people in the future and learn even more than what I know already!
